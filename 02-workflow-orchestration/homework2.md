## Question 1
I disabled the the purge_files task so that the file is not deleted after loading into postgresql database. 

This was achieved by adding the following property in the purge_files task:
```
disabled: true
````

## Question 2
According to the question, the rendered value of the variable file is made up of the following:
```
{{inputs.taxi}} = green
 _tripdata_ is a constant value
{{inputs.year}} = 2020
- is a constant value
{{inputs.month}} = 04
.csv is a constant value
```

Answer: green_tripdata_2020-04.csv

## Question 4
```shell
SELECT DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime)
FROM public.green_taxi_data
WHERE trip_distance = (SELECT MAX(trip_distance) FROM public.green_taxi_data)
```

## Question 5
```shell
SELECT tz."Zone", SUM(td.total_amount)
FROM public.green_taxi_data td
INNER JOIN public.taxi_zones tz ON td."PULocationID" = tz."LocationID"
WHERE DATE(td.lpep_pickup_datetime) = '2019-10-18'
GROUP BY tz."Zone"
HAVING SUM(td.total_amount) > 13000
```

## Question 6
```shell
WITH cte_east_halem_north_zone AS
(
	SELECT td.tip_amount, td."DOLocationID"
	FROM public.green_taxi_data td
	INNER JOIN public.taxi_zones tz ON td."PULocationID" = tz."LocationID"
	WHERE to_char(DATE(td.lpep_pickup_datetime), 'YYYY-MM') = '2019-10'
			AND tz."Zone" = 'East Harlem North'
)

SELECT tz."Zone"
FROM cte_east_halem_north_zone ez
INNER JOIN public.taxi_zones tz ON ez."DOLocationID" = tz."LocationID"
WHERE ez.tip_amount = (SELECT MAX(tip_amount) FROM cte_east_halem_north_zone)
```
